# Frontend Boilerplate

A boilerplate of things that shouldn't exist.

## Contains

- [x] Webpack
- [x] React
- [x] Redux
- [x] Babel
- [x] Autoprefixer
- [x] CSS modules
- [x] Hot reloading
- [ ] Redux router
- [ ] Redux effects

## Example

The example application is the typical TodoJS thing, needs lots of cleaning up if
anyone is interested in porting the CSS to modules, but meh, not important. A smaller / cleaner
example would be nice, possibly something utilizing the router and effects to get some middleware
involved.
